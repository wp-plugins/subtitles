Add subtitles into your WordPress posts, pages, custom post types, and themes. No coding required. Simply activate Subtitles and you're ready.

== Description ==

Right now WordPress currently presents no easy way for web publishers to add subtitles into their posts, pages, and other custom post types. This leaves users and developers in a bit of a quandary, trying to figure out how best to present subtitles in a beautiful and sensible way. Post [excerpts](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_excerpt) are a very poor choice for subtitles and the only available option outside of [custom fields](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields), but custom fields aren't entirely self-explanatory or user-friendly. This simple, straightforward plugin aims to solve this issue.

Simply download *Subtitles*, activate it, and begin adding subtitles into your posts and pages today. For more advanced usage of the plugin, please see the [Frequently Asked Questions](http://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles/faq/).

== Installation ==

By default the *Subtitles* plugin just works. All you should need to do in order to begin using it is activate the plugin and begin adding subtitles into your posts, pages, and *Subtitles*-enabled custom post types.

There are no custom template tags to add into your theme and, outside of advanced use, there is nothing you need to do to your theme in order to begin using this plugin.
